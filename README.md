# Smart-Greenhouse-Controller
A Smart Greenhouse Controller automates plant care using sensors and a microcontroller (ESP32/Raspberry Pi). It monitors temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and motion to control fans, pumps, and security features. The system ensures ideal growing conditions, saves resources, and reduces manual effort for efficient greenhouse management.
